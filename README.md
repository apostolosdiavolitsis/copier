# Copier

## Synopsis
A small Java program that searches the entire disk and copies all PDF, Word, Excel, Power Point that it finds in the directory that the program is located, usually in flash drive.
It was developed at 2011 during my first years at University.

## Motivation
A friend of mine asked for a program that does exactly that.

## Installation
Just compile and run the main Java File. I was using Netbeans to write the program.
I gave my friend a jar file in order to be able to run it easily.
